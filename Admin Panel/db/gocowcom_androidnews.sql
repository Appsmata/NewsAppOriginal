Thankfully for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a>, the contents of its executive chairman&rsquo;s cupboard were never fully revealed as plans to stage a 39th game in Asia or Australia were quickly consigned to history amid criticism from, among many others, Sir Alex Ferguson to Sepp Blatter.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/16/la-liga-stage-match-us\">The announcement</a>&nbsp;that La&nbsp;Liga plans to host regular-season games in the United States as part of a 15-year partnership will, for many supporters, have brought back bad memories of the ill-conceived&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/feb/14/newsstory.premierleague\">39th&nbsp;step</a>&nbsp;reportedly hatched by Scudamore and Rupert Murdoch&rsquo;s associate Sir Rod Eddington. But while fans in England can breathe a sigh of relief for now, the chairman of Relevent &ndash; the American firm that has won the right to stage one Spanish league match thousands of miles from home every season until 2033 &ndash; has not ruled out a similar move in future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We have always stated that we would love to have a Premier League game here but it never got beyond the boardroom,&rdquo; says Charlie Stillitano. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the things that we have talked to them about over the years. If something like the 39th game ever got off the ground, we would put ourselves forward for it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Together with the Miami Dolphins owner, Stephen Ross, Stillitano has been the driving force behind Relevent&rsquo;s attempts to build on the burgeoning market for the beautiful game in the US over the past decade. The latest edition of their International Champions Cup brainchild has seen 18 teams playing a series of pre-season friendlies spread over 22 venues but the new venture &ndash; described by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball\">La Liga</a>&nbsp;as &ldquo;an inflection point for soccer in the US and Canada&rdquo; &ndash; represents a major breakthrough that could have major implications for the game as a whole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something we have been working on for the past year and a half. A lot of leagues are looking to catch up with the Premier League and Spain is trying to make its mark,&rdquo; says Stillitano. &ldquo;This is a bold move for La Liga but it shows their ambition. A lot of leagues talk but these guys have really put themselves out there because they think this is the best way to build their brand.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet within hours of the announcement on Thursday the critics were queueing up. David Aganzo, the president of the Association of Spanish Footballers (AFE),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.as.com/en/2018/08/16/football/1534425422_092327.html\">strongly objected</a>&nbsp;to the prospect of its members being asked to fly long-haul to play a regular-season match. &ldquo;As per usual, La Liga has dispensed with the opinions of the players and has undertaken actions that only benefit them, regardless of the health or risks to the players, and even less the feelings of the following masses of the clubs who are being forced to compete in North America once a season,&rdquo; he said in a statement. &ldquo;Footballers are not currency that can be used in business to only benefit third parties.&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those fears are likely to fall on deaf ears, however. The league&rsquo;s chief executive, Javier Tebas, has long been a proponent of attempting to increase the marketability of his product and is understood to have pressed ahead with the deal despite widespread opposition among clubs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Official approval has also yet to be granted by Fifa but provisional plans are already in place to host the inaugural match before the end of this season, with Miami the most likely destination given its large Hispanic community and the success of the friendly between Real Madrid and Barcelona that was held in the city last year. A repeat of the&nbsp;<em>cl&aacute;sico</em>&nbsp;has already been ruled out, although Ross, who also owns the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami as well as the NFL franchise team, hinted on Thursday: &ldquo;I think you might have heard very much of one of the teams. One of the bigger teams.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stillitano adds: &ldquo;They&rsquo;re rumours. But it&rsquo;s fair to say one of them has to be a recognisable team. If this builds and we do it right the first time, obviously by year three or four we could have two mid-level teams but we think the first couple have to be a team people in the States will recognise. There are four or five candidates in Spain &ndash; this wouldn&rsquo;t work if you had two teams who are fighting against relegation, for example. But it will be this season, for sure. We have to look at schedules and work with the clubs but Mr Tebas is certainly committed to it, as is Mr Ross. We&rsquo;re going to shoot for this year without question.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relevent will also have access to the rights to La Liga when the league&rsquo;s $120m-a-season deal with beIN Sports ends in 2020, as well as controlling merchandise and academy initiatives at grassroots level. However, with NBC having paid the equivalent of nearly $170m a season in 2015 to broadcast the Premier League, there is no doubt who is the market leader.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Widespread opposition to the 39th game, which proposed an extra fixture for all 20 clubs being played at neutral venues around the world and all the implications that would have for a fair competition, made it a non-starter a decade ago. With Scudamore due to stand down by the end of 2018 after nearly 20 years at the helm, the Premier League currently has no plans to follow Spain&rsquo;s example and is understood to have poured cold water over the prospect at a broadcasters&rsquo; briefing last week. But Stillitano insists that market forces could mean the prospect of English league matches taking place overseas is just around the corner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I would argue that England is a very special place when it comes to tradition and the success of the league makes it even harder [to play matches abroad],&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;If you went back 15-20 years, there were half-empty stadia and you could see the possibility of playing a game overseas. Now everyone is saying: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to lose that home game&rsquo; and you can understand that. But we are working on solutions.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Since you&rsquo;re here&hellip;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&hellip; we have a small favour to ask.

Le Coq Arena in Tallinn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the La Liga season set to start at the weekend, playing 120 minutes in a venue located more than 2,400 miles from the Spanish capital was not ideal for either club.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Real&rsquo;s new manager, Julen Lopetegui, endured a nightmare start as the European champions fell behind inside a minute to a superb individual goal from Costa. The Spain striker chased his own flick on following Diego God&iacute;n&rsquo;s ball forward, held off the challenges of Ramos and Rapha&euml;l Varane and then smashed the ball past Keylor Navas at the near post from a tight angle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Navas should have done better and he probably would not have started the match had the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/09/thibault-courtois-eden-hazard-real-madrid-transfer\">new &pound;31.5m signing Thibaut Courtois</a>, who was watching from the stands, been registered to play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having not signed a replacement for Ronaldo, Lopetegui opted to select Gareth Bale in a three-pronged attack with Benzema and Marco Asensio.

He withdrew the World Cup winner Antoine Griezmann with 57 minutes played and saw his team fall behind six minutes later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Juanfran, under pressure from Benzema, was penalised for handball by the Polish referee Szymon Marciniak and Ramos coolly converted the resultant spot-kick, rolling the ball into the bottom right corner and sending Oblak the wrong way.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/aug/15/real-madrid-atletico-madrid-european-super-cup-match-report#img-2\"><img alt=\"Keylor Navas\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/873ef27917eb54d58d589993c0304a7d8ab75e39/0_50_2954_1772/master/2954.jpg?w=300&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=8654ccde317f551c32c09f7339c6b673\" /></a></h1>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&amp;href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fglobal%2F2018%2Faug%2F15%2Freal-madrid-atletico-madrid-european-super-cup-match-report%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_fb%26page%3Dwith%3Aimg-2%23img-2&amp;picture=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2F873ef27917eb54d58d589993c0304a7d8ab75e39%2F0_50_2954_1772%2F2954.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Diego%20Costa%20double%20helps%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20beat%20Real%20Madrid%204-2%20in%20Uefa%20Super%20Cup&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fglobal%2F2018%2Faug%2F15%2Freal-madrid-atletico-madrid-european-super-cup-match-report%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_tw%26page%3Dwith%3Aimg-2%23img-2\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a><a href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Diego%20Costa%20double%20helps%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20beat%20Real%20Madrid%204-2%20in%20Uefa%20Super%20Cup&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fglobal%2F2018%2Faug%2F15%2Freal-madrid-atletico-madrid-european-super-cup-match-report%3Fpage%3Dwith%3Aimg-2%23img-2&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2F873ef27917eb54d58d589993c0304a7d8ab75e39%2F0_50_2954_1772%2F2954.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Pinterest</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;Atl&eacute;tico Madrid&rsquo;s Sa&uacute;l &Ntilde;&iacute;guez (not pictured) gave Real Madrid&rsquo;s Keylor Navas no chance as he fired home his side&rsquo;s third goal.

A successful program in the heart of Manhattan in New York City, the Hunter job needed the right fit as they were not going to compete on salary. The job had been listed in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.avca.org/about/careers.html\">AVCA Online Career Center</a>&nbsp;for a couple of months, but she was not getting applicants with the experience and skills to lead her program. She was calling to ask for a more targeted approach to find candidates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We sent out multiple appeals to every sector of our community in the east &ndash; college, club, high school &ndash; and endured the wrath of those who were furious that a college was trying to hire a coach for such a paltry salary, others berating Hunter College and the AVCA for not caring about men&rsquo;s volleyball, and even some who suggested that Hunter drop men&rsquo;s volleyball if they couldn&rsquo;t afford a more significant level of commitment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fall semester started, the nontraditional season was looming, and still Hunter was without a coach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AD Wansart (pictured here) traded her pumps for sneakers and added men&rsquo;s volleyball practices to her list of duties. In her mid-fifties and by her own admission, out of shape for running practices, she shared on her last call for assistance that every part of her body hurt. One of the senior captains,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.huntercollegeathletics.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=3856&amp;path=mvball\">Steven Tarquinio</a>, picked up some of the slack by ordering equipment, scheduling transportation, and organizing weight-training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>STEVEN TARQUINIO</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally on December 15, Wansart, ever the budgeting magician, announced the hiring of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.huntercollegeathletics.com/coaches.aspx?rc=890&amp;path=mvball\">Austin Voges</a>, an experienced coach who had assisted at the Stevens Institute of Technology during several very successful seasons between 2011 and 2013. Voges&rsquo; experience was immediately obvious as he guided the Hunter team to the CUNYAC championship, a victory in the first round of the NCAA tournament, and a matchup with #1 seed Springfield College in the round of eight.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.avca.org/res/uploads/media/headshot_2_Head_Shot_NACWAA_10_2016_Terry_Wansart_contacts.jpeg\" style=\"height:149px; width:108px\" />This is where I caught up with Terry Wansart (pictured here): the beaming AD had recovered from her full-body ache and was celebrating the most successful season in school history at the NCAA banquet. In a nod to their &lsquo;against all odds&rsquo; story, Tarquinio, in his remarks to the gathering, told us they had renamed themselves &lsquo;the white van&rsquo; gang, after their signature method of transportation. The NCAA transportation allowance gave them the first opportunity of the season to travel by charter bus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stories like this can end in so many ways: fittingly, their charter had a flat tire on the morning of their match and Springfield staff had to pick them up in, you guessed it, white vans. No, Hunter did not upset the hometown favorites and go on to win the NCAA Championship, and like most successful college teams they will graduate their AVCA First-Team All-American and jack-of-all-trades, Tarquinio, along with two other senior starters, and Voges will be rebuilding next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But still, this feels like a success story for our sport!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.avca.org/res/uploads/media/Hunter-Team.JPG\" /></p>\r\n', '2018-10-30'),

After dropping the first three games of the final set, she took a medical timeout for treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Halep returned to the court and took control, running off four straight games for a 4-3 lead when rain arrived. Seventeen hours later, she was back on court and needed only 5 minutes and eight points to complete the 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 win Thursday afternoon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I have learned that I don&#39;t have to give up, because anything can happen,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Halep was scheduled to then face Ashleigh Barty in the final match of the day, but it, too, was rescheduled for Friday morning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two other second-round matches were completed on Thursday as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amanda Anisimova beat qualifier Petra Martic 6-4, 6-3 in a match suspended overnight.

The difference between calculated potential and actual performance is the athlete&rsquo;s ability to deliver and especially do so when it matters the most. For example, Bolt&rsquo;s performance in Berlin in 2009 vs the following Olympics in London in 2012 &ndash;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/aug/16/usain-bolt-world-record-100m-world-athletics-championships\" target=\"_blank\">World Championship (9.58)</a>vs&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.olympic.org/videos/bolt-takes-100m-gold-with-a-stunning-performance\" target=\"_blank\">Olympics (9.63)</a>.

However, all predictions seem to still only hover around 9.4 with the maximum human potential claimed to be at 9.36&hellip; nobody dares to even utter anything lower than that because just a &lsquo;blink in history&rsquo; ago 9.58 seemed&nbsp;out of reach. Researches even announced that they had to reassess their calculations because&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.sportsgrid.com/uncategorized/usain-bolts-claim-he-can-run-100-meters-in-9-4-seconds-is-mathematically-possible-say-researchers/\" target=\"_blank\">they couldn&rsquo;t have predicted Bolt</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was in 2008, so all eyes were on 2012 and we were amazed with the new 100m men&rsquo;s Olympic record of 9.63. But in the world of sprint it&rsquo;s miles away from 9.36.&nbsp;Running at that speed is beyond most humans. At least for now. Tracking the 100m world records through the years it&rsquo;s almost painful to look at&nbsp;the tenths of seconds involved and most humans couldn&rsquo;t be bothered. After all, some of us blink slower than that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, 9.11 is possible, and at this point and time, if anyone can do it &ndash; it&rsquo;s Bolt. Yes, his physique is a factor, so is his character and mind. But most importantly &ndash; his technique, it is his gateway to greatness. The calculations that produced the 9.36 as the maximum human speed were pure mathematics based on accumulated data of&nbsp;best times posted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, to calculate human potential based on what humans have been able to achieve thus far is to severely limit that potential. In order to correctly assess the possible potential what we need is a correct and clear conceptual&nbsp;model. In our case, it&rsquo;s a conceptual model of running. According to Dr. Romanov&rsquo;s calculations based on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://posemethod.com/running\">Pose Method of Running</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://posemethod.com/usain-bolts-running-technique/\">Bolt is capable of running 100m in 9.11 seconds</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bolt has already demonstrated that his mind is as strong as his body. Yet to break his own records&nbsp;<a href=\"https://posemethod.com/usain-bolts-running-technique/\">he would have to slightly adjust his technique</a>&nbsp;and, most importantly,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/olympics-fourth-place-medal/usain-bolt-thinks-run-9-4-no-faster-132720146--oly.html\" target=\"_blank\">break through his own perception of his own potential</a>.&nbsp;There are no &ldquo;handcuffs&rdquo; stronger than the ones in our mind.

(11, 'Running Technique Analysis: Eliud Kipchoge', 'The idea of breaking the 2 hour record in a marathon is incredibly attractive.', 1, 'upload/images/2314-2018-08-17.jpg', '<p>The idea of breaking the 2 hour record in a marathon is incredibly attractive. It actually does not matter what event we are talking about, as long as there is a potential for peak performance, potential to exceed what we thought was humanly possible &ndash; we all get emotionally invested. &nbsp;And due to popularity of running, breaking 2 hours in a marathon is of interest to many for various reasons. Anyone who dares to&nbsp;attempt such a feat deserves respect and support. This tremendous attempt by Eliud Kipchoge, Lelisa Desisa and Zersenay Tadese&nbsp;in May 2017 at Monza racing track in Italy should be the subject of analysis in order for us to understand how it was done, what was good and what was missing so that next steps in this direction are more productive.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Aerodynamic Efforts</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll skip this discussion since quite a bit has already been proposed, discussed and written about an oversized display clock mounted on top of tesla and possibly&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/uncovering-aerodynamic-trickery-behind-nikes-breaking-ferguson\" target=\"_blank\">serving as a windshield</a>&nbsp;in disguise. (What disguise?) The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.runnersworld.com/sweat-science/did-the-tesla-pace-car-aid-eliud-kipchoges-20025-marathon\" target=\"_blank\">car itself serving as a windshield</a>. The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/athletics/2017/05/06/eliud-kipchoge-falls-agonisingly-short-running-first-sub-two/\" target=\"_blank\">30 pacers</a>&nbsp;that relayed throughout the entire race and ran in a laser-guided delta formation and of course the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/06/sports/eliud-kipchoge-marathon-nike-shoes.html\" target=\"_blank\">Nike shoes</a>. Lack of competition should not be ignored either. While there were 3 key runners, this was really a one man performance, and interestingly enough Eliud Kipchoge was the only runner wearing red top. Coincidence? Maybe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily agree with the numbers and everything suggested, but those are interesting pieces of information nonetheless. There is no question that all of that helped carve out the seconds, the minutes necessary to attempt to break 2 hrs, Nike never did hide their desire to do whatever it takes to ensure a successful outcome of this publicity stunt. These efforts do help us break our mental barriers whether we want to acknowledge that or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Training Efforts</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Without a doubt no effort was spared by Nike when it came to training. That however does not mean that those efforts were right for the athletes. Leading up to the event the focus was primarily on physiology, equipment and environment. Everyone&rsquo;s focus was on finding ways to trim the time by controlling runner&rsquo;s effective weight via shoes and gear, and improving aerodynamics with the tactics mentioned earlier. The one thing that was absent was any discussion of optimizing runners&rsquo; technique. It is a shame that it is assumed that elite runners have that covered and it should not be touched. As a matter of fact everyone is afraid to tinker with individual technique. Technique is the one thing that offers ample room for improvement no matter what level the athlete is at. Things that many are so desperate to control &ndash; physiology, psychology, aerodynamics, etc &ndash; respond very well to improvements in technique. As a matter of fact that&rsquo;s the only thing that makes a real difference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://posemethod.com/running\">Optimization of running technique</a>&nbsp;at that level of performance and especially with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/running/breaking2/breaking2-runners\" target=\"_blank\">runners</a>&nbsp;like these whose technique is already very good, is not the same as on recreational or even professional and elite levels. After all, these guys are at the top due to a combination of factors that include superior technique. That said, it is vital to maintain and keep optimizing technique in order to keep on improving and to extend an athletic career. It is not difficult to look at statistics to notice that majority of outstanding athletic stars fade out too quickly and many do so way before reaching their full potential. This happens not from lack of will or desire to keep on going but simply due to injuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Running Technique Analysis</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>So, how did Eliud Kipchoge do? What aspects of his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://posemethod.com/tag/running-technique/\">technique</a>&nbsp;were good and what did he miss? From the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://posemethod.com/running\">Pose Method</a>&nbsp;point of view he executed all three elements quite good. He maintained his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://posemethod.com/running\">running pose</a>&nbsp;throughout the entire event, which is impressive on it&rsquo;s own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His cadence was a very good average for a marathon but a slight increase in cadence would have made a big difference. Time: 2:00:25, average speed 5.84m/c, average pace per km &ndash; 2:51.2; average 10km &ndash;&nbsp;28:32. At start of the race (36 seconds): cadence was 185s/m-3.08s/s, SL &ndash; 1.90m; AngleF(AF) &ndash; 17.5 deg. From first minutes into the race and to Finish stretch average cadence was around 185s/m &ndash; 3.08s/s, SL &ndash; 1.90m; AF &ndash; 17.5 deg. Analyzing support time by frames, I found that it was stable over the length of the race &ndash; 2 frames to Pose from touchdown and 1 frame for falling (from Pose to the end of support). End of support consistently appears in running Pose (swing foot near the knee of support leg &ndash; figure # 4).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Big angle of falling was easily visible throughout the race. Indication of falling by support foot heel moving up was consistent and correlated with close to the vertical body position throughout the race. Also his trailing leg basically always was bent at the knee after finishing support, which is good indication of no push off. In comparison to his teammates, who had quite big visual deviations from technique standards, which lead to their failure to maintain a given pace and basically drop out of the race before the half marathon mark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not their &lsquo;superior&rsquo; economy or oxygen consumption capacity, nor &lsquo;superior&rsquo; shoes were of any help in keeping up with such demanding pace. Their technique and mental condition discrepancy, from my point of view, were the main obstacles in handling this demanding task.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/posemethod.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Kipchoge-nike-breaking2-monza-italy-event-breaking2.png?zoom=1.25&amp;ssl=1\" style=\"height:454px; width:712px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>It is amazing to see Kipchoge maintain his running pose at this angle of falling.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order for Eliud Kipchoge (5&rsquo;6) to break 2 hours under the given conditions he needed to increase his angle of falling even more and his result would have been 1:59:24. Another way to achieve breaking the barrier would have been to increase cadence to 195 steps per minute in average and lessen the angle of falling a bit and result would have been be 1:59:19. Both ways were quite possible for this outstanding athlete with such high level of genetic capacities and successful performance in his background.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interestingly his angle of falling was a lot bigger than that of Dennis Kimetto (5&rsquo;7) in 2014 when Kimetto set a World Record of 2:02.57. According to my calculations, Kimetto achieved that with a smaller angle of falling and average cadence of 188 steps per minute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While his angle of falling varied throughout the event, his ability to produce such high angle of falling and maintain the cadence for the entire distance is very much the evidence of his capacity to keep mental focus on technique in spite of increasing fatigue. His potential capacity to break existing World Record, in my opinion, lays in primarily improving his strength conditioning, which would allow him to get the necessary cadence and his perception which would allow him to maintain the necessary angle of falling.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Training Recommendation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on limited information in regards to Kipchoge&rsquo;s training protocol and the results of Breaking2 effort, it is reasonable to suggest that there is a lack of necessary running specific strength training and a complete absence of perception development. These two crucial components are essential to moving forward and actually achieving breaking 2 hrs in marathon. Given Eliud Kipchoge&rsquo;s current level of skill, genetic potential and fantastic mental strength, it is indeed possible for him to break 2 hrs under normal race conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is my hope that Eliud Kipchoge updates his training approach and dedicates the necessary effort to the areas mentioned above and allow us to witness what once was deemed impossible.</p>\r\n', '2018-09-14'),
(12, 'Training: How To Recover Faster After a Marathon', 'What does it mean to finish a marathon?', 1, 'upload/images/8576-2018-08-17.jpg', '<p>What does it mean to finish a marathon? Many runners, especially novices, have inspiring ideas that help them get through training and to the finish line. And then the finish line looks like a battlefield with runners wobbling and hobbling around with pain all over their bodies and minds. The video clips of runners crawling across the finish line are glorified as something impressive and admirable. For most runners crossing the finish line also means continuous suffering from muscle soreness, ligament and tendon pain for days and even weeks afterwards, and forget about walking up and down the stairs &ndash; that means pure torture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you really supposed to pay like this for the pleasure of running a marathon? Is there any way to avoid this or at least reduce these unpleasant consequences? Of course!&nbsp;There is simply no reason anyone should suffer such painful consequences for simply wanting to run.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://romanovacademyofsportsscience.com/\" target=\"_blank\">My clients</a>&nbsp;go out or go shopping to celebrate right after they&nbsp;<a href=\"https://romanovacademyofsportsscience.com/training/marathon-training-program/\" target=\"_blank\">complete their marathons</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This situation has the same roots as all running related injuries do &ndash; lack of technique work and lack of adequate training.&nbsp;Lots of advice out there completely misses the point. Icing and other band-aid treatments don&rsquo;t do much as many runners already know.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Mechanism of the Injury</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In this article I want to go over the main &ldquo;injury&rdquo; associated with running a marathon &ndash; the general fatigue and excruciating soreness of your entire body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What does muscle, ligament, and tendon soreness mean? It means that all these tissues were over-stretched, over-pulled, and overloaded by your own body weight while you ran the marathon. Your body cannot handle the lengthy duration of such repetitive activity, especially with your running technique deteriorating in the process. Whether it&rsquo;s gradual or rapid, deterioration still occurs and it takes effort and focus&nbsp; to learn to maintain technique for whatever distance. If you watched the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/running/breaking2\" target=\"_blank\">Breaking 2</a>&nbsp;all the way through you must&rsquo;ve noticed that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/T_W0blad4lc\" target=\"_blank\">Eliud Kipchoge</a>&nbsp;maintained his running form from start to finish. His unyielding execution of technique and focus were impressive.&nbsp;We&rsquo;re back to the importance of technique here. Maintaining proper technique during marathon prevents injuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, our muscles contract and relax. During long repetitive work muscles lose their ability to relax, and as a consequence of that, as you run, with each step your bodyweight loads, pulls and&nbsp;stretches these unrelaxed muscles, because the normal space/time cycle of the bodyweight loading-unloading is interrupted. This is a very simple deterioration of intra- and inter-muscular coordination with extension of these negative effects on all other connective tissues: ligaments, tendons, cartilages and bones. The soreness is just a manifestation of destruction of connection and coordination between tissues. To bring your tissues back to their normal condition and to reduce the pain we need to recover their ability to contract and relax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Running with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://posemethod.com/running/\">Pose Method</a>&nbsp;gives you a chance to avoid or at least minimize these negative consequences. But what if you are not familiar with the Pose Method or didn&rsquo;t learn it well enough to run with the technique through the entire marathon?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Recommendation #1: Strength Recovery</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>How can you make your recovery faster and more effective? You need to learn a very simple procedure which I developed and call &lsquo;strength recovery&rsquo;. It is different from what&rsquo;s called an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.runnersworld.com/ask-coach-jenny/whats-the-difference-between-rest-and-active-recovery\" target=\"_blank\">active recovery.</a>&nbsp;The common active recovery is all about restoring physiological functions. Whereas the strength recovery is all about bringing back to normal function the natural&nbsp;<a href=\"https://posemethod.com/muscle-elasticity/\">muscle-tendon elasticity complex</a>. Muscles contract and relax and when that function is affected by the repetitive stress of running without adequate preparation, your tendons and ligaments, and consequently other tissue, are affected as well. It&rsquo;s a&nbsp;domino effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the strength recovery concept is based on the idea of returning to a normal contract-relax cycle of muscle work. This is achieved through the use of moderate resistance exercises for the local muscle groups to restore their normal cycle. The repetitive acceptable resistive workload allows muscles to get back to their normal condition.&nbsp;Do it in concentric regime with resistance in 2-3 sets and allow about 20 to 30 repetitions in one set in order to get your muscles to feel the burning sensation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can start doing these exercises immediately after the marathon in a gym or just in a hotel room using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://store.posemethod.com/collections/gear\" target=\"_blank\">rubber bands and StretchCordz</a>. Begin from the most loaded muscles, such as quadriceps, then to the hamstrings. Move on to your hip area, low back and low abdominal. Don&rsquo;t forget to do some exercises for your feet and ankles as well. Our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://posemethod.vhx.tv/4-week-strength-development-for-runners\">strength development video program</a>&nbsp;provides a good selection of exercises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the week following the marathon&nbsp;<a href=\"https://posemethod.vhx.tv/4-week-strength-development-for-runners/season:2\">these exercises</a>&nbsp;should be done almost every day, and then every other day, depending on the speed of your recovery and soreness going down. Along with strength exercises you should do some flexibility exercises and use them as a cool down portion of your recovery sessions. (here are a few&nbsp;<a href=\"https://posemethod.vhx.tv/flexibility-routines-for-runners/season:3\">flexibility routines you could follow</a>). It&rsquo;s a good idea to also run a bit with a moderate speed, maybe reps of 200m, or easy jogging on the grass or trails. You will be back to normal before you know it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Recommendation #2: Technique Work</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>And at the end, I return to what I always start with &ndash; technique. Unfortunately there is simply no way around it. If you start correctly, then everything else will be built correctly. You must start with improving your technique. I put together a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://posemethod.vhx.tv/12-week-marathon-prep-program\">video training program that takes a complete novice from never having run a mile to being able to complete a marathon in three months of training</a>. There is also one for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://posemethod.vhx.tv/12-week-half-marathon-prep-program\">half marathon</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://posemethod.vhx.tv/4-week-5k-prep-program\">5K</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://posemethod.vhx.tv/8-week-10k-prep-program\">10K</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is difficult to watch runners suffer when in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://posemethod.com/running\">Pose Method&reg;</a>&nbsp;the kind of recovery mentioned above usually takes just 2-3 days, or the longest up to a week, because of much less damage to all connective tissues to begin with, and whatever minor damage occurs it almost disappears within couple of days. Nevertheless my runners routinely use my strength recovery procedure to accelerate even this short time of recovery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://posemethod.com/running\">Technique</a>&nbsp;is the gateway that allows you to express your physiological gifts or make up for the lack of such and still allow you to enjoy physical activity, and without it running just isn&rsquo;t as great as it could be. Correct running technique prevents the typical injuries that are commonly referred to as overuse injuries. There is no such thing as overuse when it comes to using your body and your limbs for physical activity. There is however mediocre technique and injuries that come as a result of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With proper technique and proper training, finishing a marathon could take on a whole new meaning for you. Instead of suffering the consequences you could be enjoying the results.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Additional Recommendations</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Right after the race or in the evening I recommend to take a hot/warm bath with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/diet/apple-cider-vinegar-and-your-health\" target=\"_blank\">apple cider vinegar</a>&nbsp;which provides a very positive effect. This is a rather old recipe that is backed by experience of many generations. Additionally, a bowl of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.rodalesorganiclife.com/food/health-benefits-of-miso-soup\" target=\"_blank\">miso soup</a>would be very helpful. It is often recommended for hangover in popular culture, but I recommend it to all my athletes as a recovery food after races and sometimes after training.</p>\r\n', '2018-09-13'),

That&rsquo;s right, it was pedal-less, and also made of wood and weighed 48 pounds. It got its name &ldquo;hobby horse&rdquo; because it was designed to be a horse-less carriage. The baron patented this design in 1818, and soon after, a number of people started trying to improve the design. In 1863, a French metalworker added rotary cranks and pedals to the front-wheel hub, creating the first pedal-operated &ldquo;bicycle,&rdquo; a name that comes from the French word &ldquo;bicyclette.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>2.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.annielondonderry.com/womenWheels.html\" target=\"_blank\">The First Women&rsquo;s Bikes Had Saddles With Little or No Padding</a></strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Why? Because in the 1890s, there was concern that straddling a bike saddle &mdash; combined with the motion required to pedal a bike &mdash; would lead to arousal. Still, women rode &mdash; and the bicycle became an important vehicle for helping women become more independent. In fact, Susan B. Anthony once said bicycling did &ldquo;more to emancipate women than anything else in the world.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>3.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-expensive-bicycle-sold-at-auction/\" target=\"_blank\">The Most Expensive Bike Sold for $500,000</a></strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Lance Armstrong&rsquo;s Trek Madone, which he rode during the final stage of Tour de France in 2009, was auctioned at Sotheby&rsquo;s for a half a million dollars in November of the same year.

What&rsquo;s more, researchers believe drivers actually adjust their behavior when more bicycles are on the road, and cities start to design safer roads for cyclists.

However, if you consider the fossil fuels that go into producing the food to fuel the cyclist, it still uses some energy. That said, according to one calculation comparing bicycle versus automobile energy use (one that factors in the energy to produce the extra food a cyclist requires), bikes are 66% more efficient. Another fun calculation: If you spent a gallon&rsquo;s worth of your gas money (at $3.72/gallon) on food to fuel your biking, that $3.72 would take you 26 miles on beef, 48 miles on potatoes, 106 miles on beans and 109 miles on rice.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>8.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_helmet\" target=\"_blank\">Bike Helmets Didn&rsquo;t Exist Until 1975</a></strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Though it&rsquo;s &nbsp;hard to believe, Bell Sports introduced the first polystyrene helmet to the U.S. market in the mid-&rsquo;70s.

The nature of this activity makes it less likely that you&rsquo;ll suffer from an impact-related injury.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s going to be as simple as jumping on the bike and heading out for a ride.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To shed pounds and meet your weight goals, use these tips not only to burn the most calories but also to make your workouts as efficient as possible:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. DON&rsquo;T COAST</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the reasons you&rsquo;ll burn more calories per minute running than you will cycling is because of all the coasting. Whether you&rsquo;re riding downhill, rolling up to a stop sign or just taking a break, all those times when you&rsquo;re not pedaling lower your heart rate and kill calorie burning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you can keep your coasting to a minimum, you&rsquo;ll be surprised at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.myfitnesspal.com/exercise/calories-burned/bicycling-10-mph-leisure-cycling-biking-bike-riding-16\" target=\"_blank\">how many more calories</a>you can burn on a one-hour ride.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. EAT&nbsp;<em>AFTER</em>&nbsp;YOUR MORNING RIDE</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you wake up in the morning, your body is in a semifasted state. If you can force yourself to jump on the bike shortly after rising without eating breakfast, you can encourage your body to burn more fat, depending on the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://healthyliving.azcentral.com/role-carbohydrates-energy-storage-2630.html\" target=\"_blank\">length and intensity</a>&nbsp;of your ride.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to take it a step further, have a cup or two of plain green or black tea. This can&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21366839\" target=\"_blank\">improve your energy expenditure</a>&nbsp;(calorie burn) and make a morning ride without any food in your system a little less daunting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just remember to have a good, hearty breakfast as soon as the ride is over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. MIX IT UP</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It can be easy to get stuck in a rut when you&rsquo;re only cycling on the road. Riding the same routes at the same intensity can lead to a plateau when you&rsquo;re trying to lose weight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A good counter is to mix it up by trying a different discipline. Mountain biking and cyclo-cross, for instance, require short, explosive bursts of energy because of the terrain, which can mimic interval training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This can also be ideal if you&rsquo;re short on time. An hour on the trails will burn around 100 calories more than a steady-state ride on the road because of the increased intensity.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>READ MORE &gt;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blog.mapmyrun.com/6-tips-cycling-weight-loss/\" target=\"_blank\">6 TIPS ON CYCLING FOR WEIGHT LOSS</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>4. GO LONG</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To burn as many calories as possible, you&rsquo;ll need to have a few moderate-intensity rides per week that last two hours or more. This means staying in your aerobic heart-rate zone, around 80% or less of your maximum heart rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While high-intensity intervals will give you more bang for your buck in terms of calories burned, they should only be done a few times per week and should last around one hour. On the other hand, the long ride (more than two hours) will burn more fat, and it can be done more frequently without increasing your risk of injury.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just remember that longer rides will make you feel hungrier, so make sure you eat a healthy meal to limit your post-ride snacking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. JOIN A GROUP RIDE</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you ride alone all the time, motivation can become an issue. And when you&rsquo;re trying to burn calories, getting out the door is half the battle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether it&rsquo;s a few training partners or a group ride organized by your local bike shop, getting together with other cyclists gives you another reason to get out on the road. As an added benefit, riding with other cyclists will push you to go harder and farther than you would on your own, especially if they&rsquo;re a little faster than you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. GELS AND ENERGY BARS ARE FOR RACING</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pre-packaged energy bars and gels are convenient to replenish energy stores when you&rsquo;re out on a ride. The problem is that many of these options are denser and contain more calories than more natural food options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, tuck away a large&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.myfitnesspal.com/en/nutrition-facts-calories/banana\" target=\"_blank\">banana</a>&nbsp;(120 calories) or a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/recipe/2038839/2\" target=\"_blank\">half a peanut-butter sandwich</a>&nbsp;(around 160 calories) in your jersey pocket instead of a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.caloriecount.com/calories-powerbar-chocolate-i81925\" target=\"_blank\">PowerBar</a>&nbsp;(240 calories). These options will save you from having to burn off the extra calories out on the road.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7. BE CONSISTENT</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s face it: Getting on your bike once per week isn&rsquo;t going to get it done. Burning calories is all about accumulation, and the days will need to turn into weeks for you to begin to notice a difference in your bottom line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So instead of one slow ride for three or four hours each week, you would be fitter and burn more calories if you rode four or five days a week for an hour. It might sound like common sense, but the more often you get on your bike, the more calories you&rsquo;re going to burn and the more weight you&rsquo;re going to lose. The key is to be consistent and mix up your rides as much as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8. CHANGE UP YOUR COMMUTE</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commuting to work by bike instead of opting for morning traffic on the freeway can be a great way to lose weight. However, repeating the same route or a too-short commute can make burning calories tough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To maximize your calorie burn,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.mapmyride.com/routes/create/\" target=\"_blank\">have several routes</a>&nbsp;of varying distances and terrains. While you won&rsquo;t always have to take the long or the hard route, choosing it once or twice during the week could pay big dividends in the long run &mdash; even if it&rsquo;s only an extra 15 or 20 minutes or one additional hill.</p>\r\n', '2018-09-14'),

From shifting terminology to what it really means to shift to a harder or easier gear, use this guide to learn everything you need to know about shifting your bike.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>SHIFTING LINGO</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Before we talk about what gear is harder or easier, it&rsquo;s important to understand basic shifting terminology. Here are a few terms you&rsquo;ll need to know:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SHIFTERS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The levers on the handlebar behind the brake levers on a road bike that shift your bike (usually with a cable) to make it easier or harder to pedal</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COG</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the series of gears on the rear wheel that the chain passes over. If you have an 11-speed bike, you will have 11 cogs on your rear wheel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CASSETTE</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also commonly referred to as a cluster, the cassette is the combination of all of your cogs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CHAINRING</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The circular rings that attach to the crankarms to form a crankset. A double chainring road bike has two front rings, with a triple chainring is a crankset with three chainrings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TEETH</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The spiked portion on a chainring or on any individual cog. The number of teeth on the front chainrings of a standard crankset are 53-teeth for the big ring and 39-teeth for the small ring. For the range of cogs on a cassette, the number of teeth can vary, but typically range from 12 teeth on the smallest cog to around 28 teeth on the largest cog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DERAILLEURS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mechanism on either the front or back that shifts the chain from big chainring to small (or vice versa), or that shifts that chain up or down the cogs on the rear wheel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GEAR COMBINATION</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The combination of gears your chain is using on the front chainrings and the rear cassette. If you&rsquo;re using a 39-tooth front chainring on the front and a 17-tooth cog on the rear cassette, your gear combination would be 39T and 17T.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GEAR RATIOS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mathematical computation used to determine which gear combination is harder or easier. You need gear ratios to compare your one gear combination to the next. For example, a 39T and 17T gear combination results in a gear ratio of 2.29 (39 divided by 17 = 2.29). A 53T and 28T gear combination results in a 1.89 gear ratio.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>READ MORE &gt;&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"http://blog.mapmyrun.com/new-cyclist-checklist-cycling-101/\" target=\"_blank\">THE NEW CYCLIST CHECKLIST | CYCLING 101</a></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2><strong>BASIC SHIFTING TIPS</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Knowing what gear to shift to is only half the battle. Out on the road, shifting at the right time can help you maintain your speed without losing your momentum. Here are a few basic shifting principles you should keep in mind while you ride:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>The right shifter is for the rear cassette.</li>\r\n  <li>The left shifter is for the front chainrings.</li>\r\n  <li>If you aren&rsquo;t sure when to change gears, shift when you see more experienced cyclists shift when riding in a group.</li>\r\n  <li>Try to shift before the terrain changes, especially when approaching a climb.</li>\r\n  <li>Don&rsquo;t cross-chain, which means using the biggest chainring up front and the largest cog on your rear cassette, or using the smaller chainring up front and the smallest cog on your rear cassette. Doing so limits your options when you need an easier or harder gear, and switching from a large chainring to a small or vice versa on a climb can cause your to throw your chain.</li>\r\n <li>Treat flats like a climb, using your small front chainring and the larger cogs on your rear cassette.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n', '2018-09-14'),

Being effective means either being relaxed while swimming at slow to moderate speed or swimming fast without being exhausted too quickly. The swimming tips in this article will help you become a more effective freestyle swimmer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Swimming Tips</h2>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n <li>Keep your head in line with your trunk and look straight down toward the bottom of the pool. Don&rsquo;t look forward because otherwise you will tend to lift your head, which will, in turn, cause your hips and legs to drop and you will have to kick harder to keep them up.</li>\r\n <li><a href=\"https://www.enjoy-swimming.com/freestyle-swimming-drills-balancing-on-your-front.html\">Learn how to press your buoy</a>, which has the benefit of keeping your hips and legs up without much effort. This freestyle swimming technique requires you to apply downward pressure on your head and chest. As your lungs are filled with air and very buoyant, pressing down your upper body causes the lower body to rise through a lever effect. You then don&rsquo;t need to kick that hard anymore.</li>\r\n <li>Don&rsquo;t lift your head just before breathing. This common error also causes your hips and legs to drop. Instead, roll on your side and let your head turn a little bit further until your mouth clears the water. It should feel like your head was resting sideways on a pillow made of water.</li>\r\n  <li>Try to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.enjoy-swimming.com/front-crawl-1.html\">swim more on your sides</a>&nbsp;rather than flat on your stomach and chest. Roll from side to side with each arm stroke. This allows you to engage the larger back muscles in addition to the shoulder muscles and improves your propulsion.</li>\r\n  <li>To obtain an effective freestyle swimming technique, you need to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.enjoy-swimming.com/crawl-stroke.html\">exhale continuously in the water</a>&nbsp;while your face is submerged. There just isn&rsquo;t enough time to both inhale and exhale on the side during a breathing arm recovery. This also lets you relax more in the water.</li>\r\n <li>Learn how to swim with a so-called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.enjoy-swimming.com/how-to-swim-freestyle.html\">high elbow</a>. This freestyle swimming technique consists in flexing your arm and keeping your elbow high in the water during the underwater arm pull so that your forearm is facing backward rather than downward for as long as possible, which improves propulsion.</li>\r\n  <li>While recovering your arm forward don&rsquo;t extend it entirely above water before letting it drop in the water because it increases drag and can also lead to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.enjoy-swimming.com/swimmers-shoulder.html\">swimmer&rsquo;s shoulder</a>&nbsp;over time. It is better to enter the water with your hand shortly after it has passed your head and then to extend the arm forward under water.</li>\r\n <li>Save energy by using a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.enjoy-swimming.com/flutter-kick.html\">relaxed two-beat kick</a>&nbsp;for middle and long distance swimming.

For example, you need to synchronize breathing with arm and leg movements, movements which themselves are asymmetrical. Add to this that you need to roll on your side to breathe, and you have a few reasons why breathing needs some time to master.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s why progressive swimming drills like the ones given below can help you learn proper freestyle breathing technique.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Breathing and Swimming Drills</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Drill #1</strong>: Stand in shallow water, so that you have water up to your waist. Bow down at the hip, so that you are still standing with your chest and face horizontal and submerged. Keep your arms at your sides and exhale in the water. When you are done exhaling, turn your head to the left to inhale. When you are done inhaling, turn your head back down, and so on. Alternate the sides on which you inhale. Repeat several times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Drill #2</strong>: Is identical to drill #1, except that you add freestyle arm movements. Bow down, but this time extend both arms forward. Start to exhale in the water. When you turn your head sideways to inhale, start to sweep your arm backward on the breathing side like you would do while swimming freestyle. When you are done inhaling and start to exhale, turn your head downward and recover the active arm forward. Alternate breathing sides like you did in the previous drill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Drill #3</strong>: Put on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.enjoy-swimming.com/swimming-fins.html\">swim fins</a>, take a kickboard and hold it at arms&rsquo; length. Push off, so that you are floating in a prone position, with your face submerged and turned downward. Kick gently with your fins and exhale in the water. Rotate your head&nbsp;<em>and body</em>&nbsp;sideways to breathe in. Then roll downward again to exhale. Change the breathing side every time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Drill #4</strong>: Try to do the same as drill #3, but without a kickboard held in front of you. If this is easy, you can move on to the next drill. If this is difficult, you might have to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.enjoy-swimming.com/freestyle-swimming-drills-balancing-on-your-back.html\">improve your balance in the water</a>&nbsp;first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Drill #5</strong>: Try to swim the full freestyle stroke with fins on, and breathe on the same side for the whole length. Then change the breathing side with the next length, and so on. The swim fins will make it easier to keep your legs up and to move forward. You&rsquo;ll be able to focus on your breathing technique and to synchronize breathing with your arm stroke and body roll.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Drill #6</strong>: Is identical to drill #5, except that you now alternate breathing sides. To do so, you only inhale every third arm stroke and not every second arm stroke as you did in the previous drill. This ingrains the habit of bilateral breathing, which is important to get a balanced and symmetrical swim stroke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Swim Freestyle</strong>: Remove your swim fins and try to swim freestyle. If it is still difficult for you to coordinate breathing with swimming after several swim sessions, it might be that you are experiencing other issues in your swimming technique. If this is the case, I suggest that you practice our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.enjoy-swimming.com/learn-how-to-swim.html\">sequence of progressive drills for the freestyle stroke</a>.</p>\r\n', '2018-09-14'),

These basic strokes are the foundations that can be built upon as a player improves. It is possible to correct major technical issues at a later stage but it&rsquo;s much easier to get them right first time around. There are four basic table tennis strokes and I always strive to have my players master these before moving on to more complicated activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this post I&rsquo;ll be going through each of these four basic strokes and giving some tips and coaching points to help you successfully master them yourself or teach them to others. The four shots are;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n <li><a href=\"http://www.experttabletennis.com/forehand-drive-in-table-tennis/\">Forehand drive</a></li>\r\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.experttabletennis.com/backhand-drive-table-tennis/\">Backhand drive</a></li>\r\n <li><a href=\"http://www.experttabletennis.com/how-to-play-a-backhand-push-in-table-tennis/\">Backhand push</a></li>\r\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.experttabletennis.com/forehand-push-table-tennis/\">Forehand push</a></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve written about each of the four strokes in more detail in their own post. Just click the links above if you&rsquo;d like to read those.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The order that I have listed them is the order that I teach them in. I always start with the forehand drive as this will probably become the players most used and most important stroke. I then teach the backhand drive so that the players have a good offensive game and can rally with each other before moving on to the more defensive push strokes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong>&nbsp;In order to learn these strokes correctly you will need a bat that can generate a good amount of spin. A lot of beginners bats are &lsquo;dead&rsquo; and aren&rsquo;t able to create spin. Learning with a bat like this can have detrimental effects on your game as you learn to compensate for your poor quality bat with an unorthodox technique.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An easy way to find out if your bat is dead is to hold a table tennis ball and rub it over the surface of your rubber. If the ball slides across the rubber, with very little resistance, then your bat is probably no good. Can I please point you in the direction of my post,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.experttabletennis.com/best-table-tennis-bat-for-beginners/\">The Best Table Tennis Bat for Beginners</a>. It&rsquo;s a comprehensive guide to buying your first table tennis bat, telling you what to look for and what to avoid!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Prerequisites</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Before reading this post, and beginning to learn the basic table tennis strokes, I recommend you first have an understanding of three other table tennis basics&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n <li>The correct&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.experttabletennis.com/table-tennis-grip/\">table tennis grip</a></li>\r\n <li>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.experttabletennis.com/table-tennis-stance-and-ready-position/\">stance and ready position</a>&nbsp;we use in table tennis</li>\r\n  <li>The basic movement patterns and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.experttabletennis.com/how-to-play-table-tennis/\">table tennis footwork</a></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>I always teach these before moving onto strokes and I think it is important to learn table tennis in this order. I know the first thing you want to do when learning a new skill is get stuck in, and in table tennis that means hitting balls, but I believe it&rsquo;s much better for you, in the long run, to fully understand grip, stance and footwork before you start worrying about strokes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have laid out my manifesto for learning table tennis on the page,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pingcoach.com/how-to-play-table-tennis/\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(\'http://www.pingcoach.com/how-to-play-table-tennis/\'); return false;\">How to Play Table Tennis</a>. Please&nbsp;have a look. It&rsquo;s filled with all my best technical coaching articles and will give you the sequence and progression you need to fully develop all the important technical skills of the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, now that you&rsquo;ve mastered grip, stance and footwork lets look at the four basic table tennis strokes&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Forehand Drive</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I have written a full post on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pingcoach.com/forehand-drive-in-table-tennis/\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(\'http://www.pingcoach.com/forehand-drive-in-table-tennis/\'); return false;\">how to play a forehand drive</a>, so if you are looking for more detail that is the place to go. Otherwise enjoy this summary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I break the forehand drive down into four main parts. The stance, the backswing, the strike and the finish. Get all of these parts correct and you&rsquo;ll have a pretty good basic forehand drive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The stance</strong>&nbsp;is the first thing you need to worry about. Make sure this is correct before trying to hit any balls. You&rsquo;ll want your feet wider than shoulder width apart (some coaches even say two shoulder widths apart). If you&rsquo;re right handed, then your right foot needs to be slightly further back than your left. About half a step. Knees should be bent. Body crouched (leaning forwards) and weight on the balls of your feet (not your heels). Then put both arms out in front of you and you&rsquo;re good to go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The backswing</strong>&nbsp;is the first movement after you&rsquo;ve seen the ball. Without it your shot will lack power and you&rsquo;ll struggle to control the ball. The key things you need to remember are, rotating your body &nbsp;to the right from your hips and shifting your weight onto your back foot. Keep everything else the same as it was in the stance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The strike</strong>&nbsp;is the&nbsp;forward&nbsp;movement, towards the ball. You basically need to do the opposite of the backswing. Rotate your body to the left/forwards, from your hips. Transfers your weight from your back foot to front foot. Also remember to keep your bat angle slightly closed throughout, to take the ball at the peak of the bounce and keep a small gap between your elbow and body. To give the shot a bit of extra zip, try accelerating your forearm slightly as you make contact. This action is similar to a military salute and will give you a little extra pace and spin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The finish</strong>&nbsp;is the end point of the shot. It&rsquo;s&nbsp;important&nbsp;not to over rotate and finish with your bat over your shoulder or behind your neck, like in tennis. Instead, you should finish the forehand drive with your bat pointing where you have hit the ball. From the strike the bat should move forwards and up. &nbsp;Finally, don&rsquo;t forget to get back to your ready position so you can play the next shot!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see all of that visually, here&rsquo;s a video of a Coach Tao Li, a professional Chinese table tennis player and coach, teaching the basics of the forehand drive to a young student.</p>\r\n', '2018-09-13'),

Before hitting the trails, check out Greatist&rsquo;s guide to horsing around.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>From the Horse&rsquo;s Mouth &mdash; The Need-to-Know</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Since people first hopped into the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.equisearch.com/tack_apparel/english-tack_apparel/eqsaddleev619/\" target=\"_blank\">saddle</a>&nbsp;around&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/06/science/06horses.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">3500 BCE</a>, horses and humans have been inseparable partners in crime. When the automobile (aka &ldquo;horseless carriage&rdquo;) got popular in the late 1800s, horses became used for&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/2765777\" target=\"_blank\">recreation, not work</a>.&nbsp;<strong>These days most people pony up to exercise, compete, or just have fun.</strong>&nbsp;The first step before heading to the barn is deciding which&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.officialhorsesense.com/types-of-horseback-riding-a-beginners-guide-to-choosing-a-horse-riding-style/\" target=\"_blank\">style of riding</a>&nbsp;to try.&nbsp;<strong>Most stables teach English style or Western style, although some places offer both.</strong>&nbsp;So&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.equisearch.com/horses_riding_training/training/beginning_rider/english_western102200a/\" target=\"_blank\">what&rsquo;s the difference</a>&nbsp;between English and Western? The two styles use different equipment (aka &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.serendipityrancher.com/ee-dtack.htm\" target=\"_blank\">tack</a>&rdquo;), which affects the rider&rsquo;s position and communication with the horse. English tack is smaller and less bulky, which makes for closer contact between the horse and rider. Western saddles were originally used by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/encyclopedia/ranching/?ar_a=1&amp;ar_r=3\" target=\"_blank\">cowboys</a>&nbsp;on long cattle drives, so they&rsquo;re built for comfort and stability with a deep seat, long stirrups, and a saddle horn for looping a lasso (or hanging on!).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Giddy Up &mdash; Your Action Plan</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A new rider might feel like a sack of potatoes in the saddle, but maintaining the correct position requires a surprising amount of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.designmark.co.uk/horseways/horseriding_the_physical_benefits.html\" target=\"_blank\">strength</a>.&nbsp;<strong>Squeezing the horse to change gaits&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.equisearch.com/horses_riding_training/training/beginning_rider/fittoride/\" target=\"_blank\">works</a>&nbsp;the inner thighs, while sitting tall and straight in the saddle uses the back,<a href=\"http://www.classicaldressage.co.uk/html/muscles.html\" target=\"_blank\">abdominals</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.artofriding.com/articles/legs.html\" target=\"_blank\">legs</a>.</strong>&nbsp;Ready for the challenge? Take these steps to go from wannabe equestrian to confident cowboy (or girl).</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n <li><strong>Safety first</strong>. The first step for any new rider is to find a well-reputed local stable. Barns aren&rsquo;t supposed to smell like the Macy&rsquo;s perfume department, but&nbsp;<strong>a safe establishment should be clean, legitimate, and in good repair.</strong>&nbsp;Look for a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cha-ahse.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Certified Horsemanship Association</a>&nbsp;(CHA)-certified riding instructor who has experience with beginners.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>Dress the part.</strong>&nbsp;Wear long pants to protect legs from chafing against the saddle, and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.esc.rutgers.edu/downloads/HORSERIDING.FACTSHEET.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">close-toed shoes</a>&nbsp;with a small heel to keep feet from slipping out of the stirrups. Avoid all clothing that could get tangled in equipment including scarves, thin tank top straps, and long, loose sweaters or shirts.&nbsp;<strong>Most stables provide helmets, but call beforehand to make sure.</strong>&nbsp;Although not ideal, a bike helmet is better than nothing to protect the noggin in case of a fall.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>Drink up.</strong>&nbsp;Horseback riding, especially on a warm day, can work up a sweat, so bring a water bottle to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://greatist.com/health/how-much-water-should-i-drink-to-stay-hydrated/\" target=\"_blank\">stay hydrated</a>throughout the ride.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>Hay there!</strong>&nbsp;Arrive at the stable at least 15 minutes before the lesson time to get to know your new buddy.&nbsp;<strong>When meeting a horse for the first time, always stay towards the front and if possible,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://cha-ahse.org/store/pages/151/WHY-DO-WE-MOUNT-FROM-THE-LEFT%3F.html\" target=\"_blank\">the left side</a>.</strong>&nbsp;Horses have small brains, and they&rsquo;re trained to expect human activity (leading, saddling, mounting) from the left side. Why? Back in the day, soldiers wore swords on their left hips; if they tried to hop aboard from the right they&rsquo;d end up sitting on their weapons!</li>\r\n  <li><strong>Follow the leader</strong>. When leading a horse, stand to the left of their head and hold the long leather straps, called reins, with the right hand below their chin and with the left hand a little bit down the length of the reins so they don&rsquo;t drag on the ground.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>Listen Up</strong>. Before settling into the saddle of choice, every newbie equestrian should know a bit about how horses see the world.&nbsp;<strong>All horses, even the best-trained stable pony, are by nature&nbsp;<a href=\"http://juliegoodnight.com/questionsNew.php?id=45\" target=\"_blank\">prey animals</a>&nbsp;and genetically predisposed to run when they sense danger.</strong>&nbsp;They have sharp eyes that can see almost 360 degrees around their bodies, ears that prick with the smallest sound, and a good ability to gauge fear or danger. For this reason, it&rsquo;s always a good idea to approach a horse&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cowboyup.ca/featured_articles/horse_behavior3.html\" target=\"_blank\">confidently</a>&nbsp;from the front, speak in a low, calm voice, and avoid sudden movements or noises (so silence that Katy Perry ring tone).</li>\r\n <li><strong>Check, please.</strong>&nbsp;Before jumping into the saddle, make sure the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.equisearch.com/tack_apparel/horse-tack-check-with-lynn-palm/\" target=\"_blank\">equipment is properly placed and secure</a>. An instructor will help with this process, but even beginners can make sure the saddle doesn&rsquo;t slide around, that the stirrups are the correct length, and that the straps on the bridle are tight but don&rsquo;t restrict the horse&rsquo;s breathing.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>Up and away</strong>. Getting on a horse without help can be tricky, so look for a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Jv7GGAM3s\" target=\"_blank\">mounting block</a>, which looks like a miniature set of steps. Once the block is positioned on the horse&rsquo;s left side, put the reins over the horse&rsquo;s head. Stick the left toe in the stirrup, (the dangling metal bit hanging from the saddle). Hold the reins in the left hand, resting it on the front of the saddle.&nbsp;<strong>Put the right hand on the back of the saddle, and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.goequine.com/article/how_to_ride_a_horse_a_beginners_guide.html\" target=\"_blank\">gently hoist yourself straight up</a>, swinging the right leg carefully over the horse&rsquo;s back.</strong>&nbsp;Once one leg is on either side of the horse, sit down gently in the saddle and place the right foot in the right stirrup.</li>\r\n <li><strong>Walk the walk</strong>. Most horses have&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ultimatehorsesite.com/info/gaits.html\" target=\"_blank\">four progressively speedy gaits</a>: walk, trot, canter, and gallop. The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQxOYwYgY4E&amp;feature=list_other&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=SPF49BD1065432FAEE\" target=\"_blank\">walk</a>&nbsp;is the steadiest gait because the horse always has at least one foot on the ground. To master the walk it&rsquo;s important to relax in the saddle and move with the horse.&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"http://www.equine-world.co.uk/riding_horses/rider_position.asp#.UGnf9fmDRDQ\" target=\"_blank\">Sit up tall</a>, with shoulders squared, heels down in the stirrups, and eyes focused ahead between the horse&rsquo;s ears.</strong>&nbsp;This position is the most stable and comfortable for both horse and rider.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>Rein it in.</strong>&nbsp;To steer and stop, use the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://cha-ahse.org/store/pages/155/ENGLISH-%26-WESTERN-REIN-AIDS.html\" target=\"_blank\">reins</a>, which connect to the metal bit in the horse&rsquo;s mouth.&nbsp;<strong>Always be gentle with the reins &mdash; imagine how uncomfortable being jerked around by the mouth would be!</strong>&nbsp;Hold the reins with one in each hand, with thumbs on top. Both arms should form right angles at the elbow, with the forearms following the line of the rein. To steer left, move the left rein towards the left in a motion like opening a door. To move the horse&rsquo;s head right, do the same motion with the right rein. To stop or slow down, gently pull back on the reins while sitting up tall and pushing the heels further down. Tough as it may be, try to resist the urge to lean back and yell &ldquo;Whoa, Nellie!&rdquo;</li>\r\n <li><strong>Trot on.</strong>&nbsp;To tell the horse to go from walk to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p9Z9HLd9wo&amp;feature=relmfu\" target=\"_blank\">trot</a>&nbsp;(the next fastest gait), gently squeeze the horse&rsquo;s sides with the insides of the legs. If that doesn&rsquo;t get things moving, give the horse a gentle kick with the heels.&nbsp;<strong>A stable seat is key to preventing getting&nbsp;<a href=\"http://cha-ahse.org/store/pages/145/INTRODUCING--THE-TROT.html\" target=\"_blank\">bounced out of the saddle</a>.</strong>&nbsp;Sit deeply, press those legs down, and keep the back tall and straight (but not stiff). In English riding, more advanced riders use their legs to lift in and out of the saddle in time with the horse&rsquo;s movement; this is called &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.horsechannel.com/english-horse-training/horse-posting-trot-9753.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">posting</a>.&rdquo;</li>\r\n <li><strong>Rock n&rsquo; roll.</strong>&nbsp;Ready for more speed? The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETtryKb3-aQ&amp;feature=relmfu\" target=\"_blank\">canter</a>&nbsp;is the fastest gait used in most recreational horseback riding. (The gallop is too speedy to be safe in a riding ring or on a trail where unexpected obstacles might emerge at any time.)&nbsp;<strong>The canter is more&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.horsechannel.com/english-horse-training/sit-the-canter.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">forward-backward</a>&nbsp;than side-to-side, which is why it&rsquo;s often compared to a rocking horse.</strong>&nbsp;For this gait, sit deeply and add pressure with both legs while keeping the back straight and tall to avoid tumbling forward.</li>\r\n <li><strong>Chill out.</strong>&nbsp;Just like with any exercise, it&rsquo;s important to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.equisearch.com/uncategorized/cooling-out-hot-horse/\" target=\"_blank\">cool down</a>&nbsp;after a horseback riding session.&nbsp;<strong>Walk the horse for 10-15 minutes, or until its neck is room temperature.</strong>&nbsp;To&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIbHkcQS-Y\" target=\"_blank\">dismount</a>, come to a complete stop and take both feet out of the stirrups. With the left hand, hold both reins and grab the lower part of the horse&rsquo;s neck (called the withers). Grab the pommel of the saddle with the right hand, and slowly swing the right leg over the horse&rsquo;s back and carefully slide down towards the ground.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n', '2018-09-14'),

If you are thinking about a million and one other things, it will be difficult to concentrate on the game and give it your all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The physical preparation involves strength and&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance_training\" target=\"_blank\">endurance training</a></strong>. No one goes from living a sedentary lifestyle to instantly playing volleyball in the championships. It involves a significant amount of practice and training in order to get your body ready for the game and the demands that will be made of you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Study Your Opponent</strong><br />\r\nEvery sports team that is competitive studies their opponent. Football teams watch videos of their opponents all the time. Volleyball players do the same. This gives you the opportunity to see how the other players work and work together. This will allow you to learn more about their maneuvers and anticipate similar activity when they play against you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Predict the Game</strong><br />\r\nIt&rsquo;s important to try and predict the game. This means thinking ahead and being ready for what&rsquo;s going to happen next.

If you know how to play smart volleyball and either play or an avid fan, sports betting might be something to explore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Stay Focused</strong><br />\r\nYou need to stay focused at all times. The moment you get distracted by fans or let the opponent in your head, it will be difficult to focus on the game. You need to tune everyone and everything else out. Be in tune with the ball and with your team in order to be smart about the way you play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Concentrate on Your Game</strong><br />\r\nFinally, you need to make sure you are concentrating on your game. At quick glance, volleyball looks like it is all about the power in which you can hit the ball over the net. However,&nbsp;<strong>it&rsquo;s more than power and strength</strong>. You have to use technique in order to play a good game. Otherwise, the team that has more technique will be able to overcome the sheer force that you use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are plenty of tips to help you calm a smarter volleyball player.

But it is also one of the deadliest because symptoms almost never develop until the disease is advanced and incurable.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Although 55,440 cases, affecting 29,200 men and 26,240 women, are expected to be diagnosed this year in the United States, 44,330 people will die of it, often within months of diagnosis, making it the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in this country (after lung, colorectal and breast cancer). Furthermore, it is on track to become the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pancreatic-cancer-will-be-2nd-deadliest-cancer-by-2030-study/\" target=\"_blank\">second most deadly cancer by 2030</a>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, cases of pancreatic cancer are rising, even though the leading known risk factor &mdash; cigarette smoking &mdash; has been declining for decades. That fact alone has prompted researchers to seek explanations for other causes and, it is hoped, find ways, in addition to quitting smoking, to prevent it and detect it while still curable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In most of the approximately 6 percent of five-year survivors, pancreatic cancer is discovered early quite by accident, usually during a scan or surgery for some other reason. For example, in 2009, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the associate justice of the Supreme Court, had part of her pancreas removed after a routine CT scan revealed a one-centimeter lesion. While that lesion was benign, a smaller tumor the surgeon found was malignant and had not yet spread beyond the pancreas.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The pancreas is a small two-part glandular organ &mdash; about 7 inches long and 1.5 inches wide &mdash; lying in the upper abdomen behind the stomach. It performs two vital functions. One part of the gland is a source of digestive enzymes and the other part produces the hormones insulin and glucagon that control blood levels of glucose and fatty acids.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', '2018-10-30');
